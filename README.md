# Q-Learning Grid World

## Description
This project implements the Q-Learning algorithm on a simple 4x4 grid world environment. And some statistics about the learning process.
## Features
- Reinforcement learning with Q-Learning
- Grid World environment
- Visualization of the optimal policy using Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone <lien-du-repo>

2. Install dependencies:
pip install numpy matplotlib

3. Run the script:
   You can run TDlearning.py first to see the 4x4 grid world environment, and then run visualisation.py to generate additional graphs.
